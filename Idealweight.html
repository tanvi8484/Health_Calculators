            <h3>Understanding Ideal Weight</h3>
            <p>Your ideal weight can vary based on various factors including age, gender, and body composition. Generally, a healthy weight is important for overall health and can reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p>
            <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a common method used to assess whether you are in a healthy weight range. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive assessment.</p>
