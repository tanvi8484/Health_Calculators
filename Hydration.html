            <h3>Why is Hydration Important?</h3>
            <p>Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health. Water helps to regulate body temperature, keeps joints lubricated, and delivers nutrients to cells. It also helps to keep organs functioning properly and can improve sleep quality, cognition, and mood.</p>
            <p>It's important to drink enough water, especially during hot weather or when exercising. Aim to drink at least 2-3 liters of water daily, but individual needs may vary.</p>
